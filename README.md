# ngSocket

## Status: In-Development

An AngularJS 1.2 service for connecting applications to servers with WebSocket support.

## Usage

bower install ngSocket

```javascript
.controller('SomeController', function (ngWebSocket) {
  //Open a WebSocket connection
  var ws = ngWebSocket('ws://foo/bar');

  //Can call before socket has opened
  ws.send({foo: 'bar'});
});
```

## API

### Factory: `ngWebSocket` (in module `ngSocket`)

returns instance of NGWebSocket

### Methods

name        | arguments                                              | description
------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------
ngWebSocket <br>_constructor_ | url:String                           | Creates and opens a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) instance. `var ws = ngWebSocket('ws://foo');`
send        | data:String,Object                                     | Adds data to a queue, and attempts to send if socket is ready. Accepts string or object, and will stringify objects before sending to socket.
onMessage   | callback:Function <br>pattern:String,RegExp:_optional_ | Register a callback to be fired on every message received from the websocket, or optionally just when the message's `data` property matches the string or pattern provided. Callback gets called with a [MessageEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=WebSockets%2FWebSockets_reference%2FMessageEvent) object.
onOpen      | callback:Function                                      | Function to be executed each time a socket connection is opened for this instance.
close       | force:Boolean:_optional_                               | Close the underlying socket, as long as no data is still being sent from the client. Optionally force close, even if data is still being sent, by passing `true` as the `force` parameter. To check if data is being sent, read the value of `socket.bufferedAmount`.

### Properties
name               | type             | description
-------------------|------------------|------------
socket             | window.WebSocket | [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) instance.
sendQueue          | Array<function>  | Queue of `send` calls to be made on socket when socket is able to receive data. List is populated by calls to the `send` method, but this array can be spliced if data needs to be manually removed before it's been sent to a socket. Data is removed from the array after it's been sent to the socket.
onOpenCallbacks    | Array<function>  | List of callbacks to be executed when the socket is opened, initially or on re-connection after broken connection. Callbacks should be added to this list through the `onOpen` method.
onMessageCallbacks | Array<function>  | List of callbacks to be executed when a message is received from the socket. Callbacks should be added via the `onMessage` method.
readyState         | Number:readonly  | Returns either the readyState value from the underlying WebSocket instance, or a proprietary value representing the internal state of the lib, e.g. if the lib is in a state of re-connecting.

### Service: `ngWebSocketBackend` (in module `ngSocketMock`)

Similar to [`httpBackend`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock.$httpBackend) mock in AngularJS's `ngMock` module

### Methods

name                           | arguments  | description
-------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------
flush                          |            | Executes all pending requests
expectConnect                  | url:String | Specify the url of an expected WebSocket connection
expectClose                    |            | Expect "close" to be called on the WebSocket
expectSend                     | msg:String | Expectation of send to be called, with required message
verifyNoOutstandingExpectation |            | Makes sure all expectations have been satisfied, should be called in afterEach
verifyNoOutstandingRequest     |            | Makes sure no requests are pending, should be called in afterEach

## Logical Questions

 * *Q.*: What if the browser doesn't support WebSockets?
 * *A.*: This module will not help; it does not have a fallback story for browsers that do not support WebSockets.

## Development

`$ npm install .`
`$ bower install`

### Unit Tests
`$ npm test` Starts karma and watches files for changes

### Manual Tests

In the project root directory:

`$ node test-server` Starts a sample web socket server to send/receive messages
`$ ./node_modules/.bin http-server` - Basic http server to seve a static file
Open localhost:8081/test-app.html and watch browser console and node console to see messages passing

### Distribute
`$ ./dist.sh` For now just copies `src/ngSocket.js` to `dist/` (bower is configured to ignore src/ and test, plus pretty much everything else)

## TODO
 * Automatic re-connection when connection lost
 * Return a promise when calling `send()`
 * Be able to cancel a send without looking it up in an array.
 * Add `onerror` to allow applications to respond to socket errors in their own ways
 * Consider support for ArrayBuffer and Blob datatypes
 * Add `protocols` parameter to constructor
